# PROHEALTH
# Week 1: Initial Setup & Patient System Development
Day 1: Planned the entire project, listed objectives, analyse timelines.

Day 2: Researched hospital management systems like fortis, apollo, prolife hospital websites , existing appointment and bed allocation solutions, and noted the essential features to include.

Day 3: Started working on the patient self-enrollment module, designed the UI for registration and login pages.

Day 4: Implemented user authentication, allowing patients to create accounts securely. Tested login and logout functionality.

Day 5: Designed the symptoms submission module, created a form where patients can enter symptoms in a structured format.

Day 6: Developed the symptom analysis system, linking it with a medical database to recommend relevant tests.

Day 7: Started the appointment booking module, worked on the logic for doctor availability and time slot selection.

# Week 2: Appointments booking setup
Day 8: Integrated test recommendations with appointment scheduling, so patients can book tests before meeting a doctor.

Day 9: Encountered an issue where patients booked overlapping appointments; fixed it by restricting multiple bookings in the same time slot.

Day 10: Began work on the bed allocation system, created a database structure to store ward and bed availability.

Day 11: Developed the bed assignment logic, enabling automatic allocation of available beds to new patients.

Day 12: Found a major issue where multiple patients were assigned the same bed; worked on fixing this bug.

Day 13: Improved bed status updates, so beds are marked as "occupied" or "available" in real time. Added a manual override feature for hospital staff.

Day 14: Made test recommendations more accurate, refining the logic to better match symptoms with appropriate medical tests.

# Week 3:work on UI Enhancements & Bed Allocation 
Day 15: Improved UI for patient registration and appointment booking to make it more user-friendly.

Day 16: Encountered a database issue where test recommendations were not being saved properly; worked on fixing it.

Day 17: Implemented email and SMS notifications, ensuring that patients receive reminders for their appointments and test bookings.

Day 18: Conducted testing on all features so far. Noted that bed allocation still needs further improvement.

Day 19: Worked on error handling to improve user experience, added meaningful validation messages for incorrect inputs.

Day 20: Optimized database queries to speed up system performance and improve response time.

Day 21: Integrated basic security features, including encryption for patient data and secure access controls for doctors and admins.

# Week 4:Testing System & Final touches
Day 22: Tested the bed allocation system under different patient admission scenarios, found issues with ICU bed assignments and fixed them.

Day 23: Enhanced appointment scheduling UI, making it more visually appealing and easier to navigate.

Day 24: Completed final testing for the patient registration, symptom submission, medical test recommendation, and appointment modules.

Day 25: Attempted to implement real-time bed status updates but faced some challenges in refreshing data dynamically.

Day 26: Finalized UI and responsiveness across different devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

Day 27: Worked on documentation, explaining each module's functionality, project objectives, and system flow.

Day 28: Conducted manual testing with sample patient data, checked how well the test recommendations worked based on various symptoms.

# Week 5: Final Fixes, Reporting & Submission
Day 29: Added basic reporting features, including patient statistics, bed occupancy rates, and appointment trends.

Day 30: Refined bed allocation logic, ensuring dynamic reassignment when beds become available.

Day 31: Fixed minor UI and bug issues, improving the overall stability of the system.

Day 32: Performed final system testing, identified an issue with doctor availability updates and corrected it.

Day 33: Organized code files, cleaned up unused scripts, and reviewed the documentation for submission.

Day 34:  Successfully implemented Objective 1 (Patient System) and part of Objective 2 (Bed Allocation System).
